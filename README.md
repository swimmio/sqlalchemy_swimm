# SQLAlchemy Public Swimm Playlist

## Setup

There are two things you need in order to run the relevant tests for the unit in this repo:

- Have the `python` command in your path, which will point to a version `X` of Python where `X>=3.8`.
- Have `SQLAlchemy` installed in your Python environment.
- Have `pytest` installed in your Python environment.

We recommend using [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) in order to setup a virtual environment that satisfies all of the requirements above.
