# SQLAlchemy Public Swimm Playlist

Learn `SQLAlchemy` from the bottom up as you try to earn your dream job at the _Rock Em' Socks!_ musical emporium.

## SQLAlchemy?

`SQLAlchemy` is a popular SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper. It is written in Python and gives full power and flexibility of SQL to an application developer. It is an open source and cross-platform software.

In this Playlist you will get a hands-on experience that will make you feel confident about the basics of `SQLAlchemy`!

## Prerequisites

* You need to know what SQL is, being able to run basic queries and understand how a DB is structured.
* Basic Python knowledge.

## Setup

There are two things you need in order to run the relevant tests for the unit in this repo:

* Have the `python` command in your path, which will point to a version `X` of Python where `X>=3.8`.
* Have `SQLAlchemy` installed in your Python environment.
* Have `pytest` installed in your Python environment.

We recommend using [`Pipenv`](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) in order to setup a virtual environment that satisfies all of the requirements above (although a classic [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt) is also provided).
