# SQLAlchemy Public Swimm Playlists

Learn `SQLAlchemy` from the bottom up as you try to earn your dream job at the _Rock Em' Socks!_ musical emporium.

## SQLAlchemy?

`SQLAlchemy` is a popular SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper. It is written in Python and gives full power and flexibility of SQL to an application developer. It is an open source and cross-platform software.

In this Playlist you will get a hands-on experience that will make you feel confident about the basics of `SQLAlchemy`!

## Playlists Overview

The Playlists in this repo are supposed to present bite-sized exercises (or as we in Swimm call them, _Units_) that give you the building blocks necessary to create more complicated scripts and projects later on.
As a bonus and to ease your progress as you slowly "learn to swim", the Playlists will follow the whimsical tale of a developer (you!) applying to their dream job at a record store, so you won't feel alone as you start to dive deeper into material.

### Unit Structure

Before you take your first few steps it's important to set our expectations:

* Each Unit you will be asked to make some tests pass (use `swimm test` as a shortcut for that) and will be presented with the files necessary for you to edit after you `swimm play`.
* The **technical specifications** of what you need to achieve will be written as docstrings inside the **code itself**.
* The Units descripions themselves will not focus on teaching new `SQLAlchemy` concepts, but instead will offer some _"Recommended References"_ that will help you solve this specific challenge. We encourage you to search online and dive deeper on your own!

## Prerequisites

* You need to know what SQL is, being able to run basic queries and understand how a DB is structured.
* Basic Python knowledge.

## Setup

There are several things you need in order to run the relevant tests for the unit in this repo:

* Have the `python` command in your path, which will point to a version `X` of Python where `X>=3.8`.
* Have `sqlalchemy` installed in your Python environment.
* Have `pytest` installed in your Python environment.

We recommend using [`Pipenv`](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) in order to setup a virtual environment that satisfies all of the requirements above (although a classic [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt) is also provided).
