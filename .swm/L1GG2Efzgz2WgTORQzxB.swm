The `Alphabetical` corporation wants to sponsor `Rock Em' Socks!` !\n\nThere's a big promotion sale happening and they want in, but they have one condition: they want on the poster only the artists who's name first letter is the most common out there. Alphabets!\n\nHelp arrange `Rock Em' Socks` unlikely sponsor's wishes.\n\nIn this unit we'll learn about using SQL functions and chaining multiple directives to our query.\n\n# Recommended References\n* https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/query.html",
    "summary": "In this unit we've covered a lot:\n* Grouping data using `group_by`.\n* Ordering data using `order_by` in combination with `desc` and `asc`.\n* When to use `filter` and when to use `having`.\n\nMost basic Query APIs have been covered here, so we're almost 100% ORM experts now!",
