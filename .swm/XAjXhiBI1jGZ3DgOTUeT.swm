Perhaps `Pop Em' Socks!` will make a comeback? What about `Jazz Em' Socks!` or `Blues Em' Socks!` ? Only one way to find out!\n\nIn this unit we'll learn about joining tables together for fun and (mostly) profit.\n\n## Recommended References:\n* https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy_orm_working_with_joins.htm\n* https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/tutorial.html#querying-with-joins"
